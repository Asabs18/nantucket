## Project Description

### Lesson Summary

- [ ] 2023-01-23:
  - [ ] Discussed our respective sports teams (let me know when you want to learn about 🏒), `TODO.MD` and progress on our respective spikes
  - [ ] Tried to get CSV integration working but ran into bunch of github issues…*luckily, not as bad as it looked*
  - Next
    - [ ] as: update sources/GitHub back to *spec*
    - [ ] as: Edit away all dead/commented code
    - [ ] as: Update CSV code to create one file instead `multiTrials`
    - [ ] as: Eliminate `multiTrials`
    - [ ] as: Complete CSV integration
    - [ ] as: Charting spike

### Backlog

- [ ] as: Try to get go results to match pdf (Rewrite init functions to fix)
- [ ] as: Look into concurrent potential (Trials, Days, People)
- [ ] as: Look over c code (and rest of the project) for guidance   
- [ ] as: Charting spike
- [ ] as: Integrate charting support
- [ ] as: Integrate gogo features (e.g., concurrency, configuration…)

### Todo

- [ ] as: Change structure from serial to concurrent model based on trial
- [ ] as: Spike visualize
- [ ] as: Write visualize
- [ ] as: SPIKE: go routines and channels
- [ ] as: Collect time for each trial and overall time + other statistics/subsequent cmdLineVars
- [ ] as: Unit tests

### In Progress

- [ ] as: update nantucket to use gota and to read and write to csv file
- [ ] as: Decide plotting package and do a small spike
- [ ] as: Unit tests (Use to do spike on data and maybe plotting package)
- [ ] as: Use the output file from cmdLineVars to store csv data
- [ ] djg: Viper spike
- [ ] as: Feedback on gogo
- [ ] as: Use the output file from cmdLineVars to store csv data
- [ ] djg: Surface all constants in the c-version  
- [ ] djg: Spec out MT version
