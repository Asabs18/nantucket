# Project

## Project Description

### Lesson Summary

- [ ] 2023-02-13:
  - Discussed graphics and how to scale/map a `(n x m)` matrix to a `(R x C)` (visual) display w/cells of size `(r x c)`
  - Spent too much time (‚ùó) playing w/time formatting in order to generate unique, structured file names
  - [ ] Next
    - [ ] as: clean up TODO.md
    - [ ] djg: review pygame  GOL and A* visualizers
    - [ ] djg: continue game engine / graphics spike
    - [ ] djg: complete gogo
    - [ ] as: reinstall/reestablish environment
    - [ ] as: complete CSV support
    - [ ] as: begin integration of visualize support

- [ ] 2023-02-05:
  - Discussed state of `gogo` 
    - djg: propagation of configuration mechanism to all illustrations
    - djg: documentation
  - Discussed next project ‚Äì some sort of _cellular automata_ or _genetic algorithm_ **playground** (_laboratory_üòé‚ùì)
    - [simgo package - github.com/fschuetz04/simgo - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fschuetz04/simgo)
    - [About PySim ‚Äì PySim](https://pysim.org/about/)
    - Game engines ‚Äì text vs. graphical, rules engines ‚Äì flexibility, domain specific, knowledge base, grids, Conway‚Äôs GOL, etc.
  - Looked at Visualize Spike code and researched how to render HTML at run-time
    - **as: Would a direct image/charting/graphics package be better or too complex for Nantucket‚Äôs needs?**
  - Ran `Cute Mold` and `Protozoa` - partial inspiration for new project ‚Äì on Windows w/o any issues‚ùó
    - djg: GitPod attempt confrms issue is most likely OpenGL on Linux
  - Next
    - as: complete Visualize spike
    - as/djg: discuss next project

- [ ] 2023-01-23:
  - [ ] Discussed our respective sports teams (let me know when you want to learn about üèí), `TODO.MD` and progress on our respective spikes
  - [ ] Tried to get CSV integration working but ran into bunch of github issues‚Ä¶*luckily, not as bad as it looked*
  - Next
    - [ ] as: update sources/GitHub back to *spec*
    - [ ] as: Edit away all dead/commented code
    - [ ] as: Update CSV code to create one file instead `multiTrials`
    - [ ] as: Eliminate `multiTrials`
    - [ ] as: Complete CSV integration
    - [ ] as: Charting spike

### Plot / Image Viewing
- Using the `image` pkg and one of these might make it easier to display images at run-time
  - [img command - github.com/codeliveroil/img - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/codeliveroil/img#section-readme)
  - [preview package - github.com/joshdk/preview - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/joshdk/preview#section-readme)
- A few plotting pkgs:
  - [Plotting in Golang - Histogram, BarPlot, BoxPlot - Golang Docs](https://golangdocs.com/plotting-in-golang-histogram-barplot-boxplot)
  - [Arafatk/glot: Glot is a plotting library for Golang built on top of gnuplot.](https://github.com/Arafatk/glot)
  - [gonum/plot: A repository for plotting and visualizing data](https://github.com/gonum/plot)
- A list/site you should know about:
  - [A curated list of awesome Go frameworks, libraries and software - Awesome Go / Golang](https://awesome-go.com/#gui)

### Backlog

- [ ] as: Try to get go results to match pdf (Rewrite init functions to fix)
- [ ] as: Look into concurrent potential (Trials, Days, People)
- [ ] as: Look over c code (and rest of the project) for guidance   
- [ ] as: Charting spike
- [ ] as: Integrate charting support
- [ ] as: Integrate gogo features (e.g., concurrency, configuration‚Ä¶)

### Todo

- [ ] as: Change structure from serial to concurrent model based on trial
- [ ] as: Spike visualize
- [ ] as: Write visualize
- [ ] as: SPIKE: go routines and channels
- [ ] as: Collect time for each trial and overall time + other statistics/subsequent cmdLineVars
- [ ] as: Unit tests

### In Progress

- [ ] as: update nantucket to use gota and to read and write to csv file
- [ ] as: Decide plotting package and do a small spike
- [ ] as: Unit tests (Use to do spike on data and maybe plotting package)
- [ ] as: Use the output file from cmdLineVars to store csv data
- [ ] djg: Viper spike
- [ ] as: Feedback on gogo
- [ ] as: Use the output file from cmdLineVars to store csv data
- [ ] djg: Surface all constants in the c-version  
- [ ] djg: Spec out MT version
